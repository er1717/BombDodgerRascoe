My Spin on Classic Minesweeper game

The task was to complete a Minesweeper game as quickly as possible using the Starling Framework, which is optimized for Mobile.
This project is my spin on the Classic Minesweeper game. It may have some subtle differences here and there but
all of the primary function is the same. I was able to complete this project in two days. This has my take on MVC. If you want to actually build this game as a project 
you will need to insall the Starling and Feathers Frameworks sdk and add them to the project.
