My Spin on Classic Minesweeper game

The task was to complete a Minesweeper game as quickly as possible using the Starling Framework, which is optimized for Mobile.
This project is my spin on the Classic Minesweeper game. It may have some subtle differences here and there but
all of the primary function is the same. I was able to complete this project in two days. This has my take on MVC. If you want to actually build this game as a project 
you will need to insall the Starling and Feathers Frameworks sdk and add them to the project. 


To Play the game. 

When the game Starts you will have 3 modes to Choose From: Easy, Medium, Hard in which you will have 100, 200, and 300 seconds respectively to finish the game before it ends. Easy is the best mode to play for beginners until you get the hang of the game and find certain patterns that you can use to help you tell which tiles are bombs and which ones are not. The number on the left of the game beneath the Restart button is the number of non bomb tiles that are remaining that can be clicked. The nunmber on the right of the game is the number of seconds remaining in the game.

Regular Mode is the mode that you will play the game in by selecting tiles on the game board. You can use Mark Mode to mark which tiles you suspect are bombs to help you keep away from them. To do this just the MarkMode label and the game modes will toggle between Mark Mode and Regular mode.

If you reveal all of the non bomb tiles before the time runs out, you will win the game and will be congratulated and the option to play again. When you reveal all of the non bomb tiles the number below the Restart button will be 0.

If you do not reveal all of the the non bomb tiles before the time expires. The game will end and reveal to you the location of all of the Bomb Tiles, and you will have the option of playing again.
